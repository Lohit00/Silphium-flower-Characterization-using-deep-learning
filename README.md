Data Annotation.py has code that compares the original and segmented images side by side for visual comparison, from this, we can know how good is our image from the original image.

Merging_ExcelFIles.py is used for merging all Excel files into a single file

renaming_excel_files.py is used for renaming all the Excel files which helps from resolving merge errors i.e files with the same names

saved_images.py is used to perform semantic segmentation to isolate yellow flowers but also identifies and displays the main flower in each segmented image

verifying.py is used for the verification of labeled images by comparing expected region counts.


The Ipython Notebook uses the pre-processed image data directly.

We could not upload the additional folders to github as the files were too large and Github allows the files which are <=25 MB. So we are attaching a google drive link below which contains additional folders for Combined excel data, Modifiied images and Bounding box
